00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,560
Salam and welcome. I am Asma

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,720
and I am Hamza. Welcome to episode four

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,559
of Project Void Sapencast.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,559
So for this deep dive, we're looking at

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,880
something really, really significant.

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,880
Our source material isn't, you know, a

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,199
modern research paper. It's a detailed

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,960
conversation from millennia ago.

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,840
That's right. It's between Imm Jafar

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,600
Sadik and his companion Mufal Ibanar.

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,439
And our mission today is to really crack

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,080
this open and unpack the arguments

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,279
inside.

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,240
Exactly. The text is like a

15
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,239
philosophical tour. It asks you to just

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,000
observe. Yeah. To see the detailed

17
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,559
design and purpose and planning that's

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,320
everywhere

19
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,960
from the cosmos right down to a single

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,960
plant.

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,360
Yes. And to consider what all these

22
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,280
meticulously crafted systems might imply

23
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,280
about an all- knowing designer.

24
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
It feels like a shortcut to some of the

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,680
most ingenious arguments for intelligent

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,120
design, but derived purely from

27
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,960
observing the natural world.

28
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,079
It is. So, we're going to approach this

29
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,160
with a um a thoughtful and composed

30
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,280
tone. The focus here is on the careful

31
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,960
reasoning presented.

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,640
Okay. So, the material presents the

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,119
universe as a series of constant

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,280
observable signs. Where do we start?

35
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,880
Well, let's start with the macro level.

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
The organization of the heavens and how

37
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,600
they seem to be customtailored for human

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
welfare.

39
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,799
All right, let's unpack that. And we can

40
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,560
start with something we see every single

41
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,799
day but probably never think of as

42
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,280
utility. The sky itself.

43
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,200
The sky. Yes. The source material points

44
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,200
out the wisdom in the sky's actual

45
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,000
color. It's described as having this

46
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,759
green hue inclined to be dark.

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,240
And that's not just for aesthetics.

48
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,720
No, far from it. This specific color is

49
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,000
described as the most appropriate tonic

50
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,119
for human eyesight.

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,439
A tonic.

52
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,200
Exactly. The argument notes that even

53
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,079
professional physicians would advise

54
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,040
patients with weakened sight to gaze at

55
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,560
green or darker hues. The sky is

56
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,799
designed this way so that constantly

57
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
looking at it doesn't cause uh

58
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,840
imperfection or strain. So the ceiling

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,479
of our world is a kind of permanent

60
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,159
healthy prescription, a cosmic health

61
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,600
insurance policy for our eyes.

62
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,799
It really reframes the whole idea,

63
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,799
doesn't it? It suggests the system

64
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,719
wasn't just built and then we'd adapted

65
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,239
to it. The system was built for us.

66
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,120
Okay, so let's move from that to the

67
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,599
solar cycle. The necessity of sunrise

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,680
and sunset. The sunrise part is obvious.

69
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,760
You need it for business and livelihood,

70
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,160
right? But the source really emphasizes

71
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,440
the critical necessity of darkness.

72
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,920
Why is that? Well, if the sun never set,

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,720
human beings would have no comfort, no

74
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,720
real rest. Your body absolutely needs

75
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,239
the night to recuperate, to process

76
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,000
food, to relax.

77
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,440
And there's a fascinating psychological

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,959
detail in there, too, isn't there?

79
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,160
Yes. About human nature.

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,160
The mention of greed.

81
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,280
Precisely. The text notes that without

82
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,680
the inevitability of night, human greed,

83
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,160
that relentless drive for more would

84
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,000
cause serious bodily harm because people

85
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,760
would just never stop working. So

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,160
darkness forces us to rest.

87
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,840
It's not just a biological need. It's a

88
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,360
preventative measure against our own

89
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
self-destructive tendencies.

90
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,080
And that regulated cycle leads directly

91
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
into the seasons.

92
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,840
It does. It extends into the four

93
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,920
seasons which are caused by the sun's

94
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,280
consistent elevation and incl. This

95
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,280
isn't random. It's an orderly

96
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,800
succession. And each season has its own

97
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,879
unique planned purpose.

98
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,879
Like winter, for example. It's seen as

99
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,120
essential for purifying the air. And the

100
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,040
longer nights can aid certain tasks.

101
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,040
Whereas summer's heat is necessary for

102
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,640
ripening fruit and helping the body

103
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,400
remove waste products.

104
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,239
And this whole movement of the sun

105
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,360
through what the source calls the 12

106
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,959
zodiac belts,

107
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,040
what we call the constellations,

108
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
right? That movement completes the

109
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,879
measure of the year,

110
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,720
a fixed measure. And without that, human

111
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,280
society couldn't function. You couldn't

112
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,680
calculate lifespans, finalize contracts,

113
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,519
structure loans. Stability requires

114
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,280
calculable time. This is where the

115
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,599
planning gets really clear with the

116
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,159
sun's motion itself rising in the east,

117
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,319
setting in the west constantly. Why is

118
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,159
that sweeping motion so important?

119
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,400
To make sure no part of the earth is

120
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,000
left without light or benefit for too

121
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,159
long. I mean, can you imagine the

122
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,560
catastrophe if the sun just shone on one

123
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,400
spot

124
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,640
or if its motion was erratic?

125
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,959
Civilization would be impossible. This

126
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,280
continuous automatic function with no

127
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,439
negligence. It's held up as proof of

128
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,040
overwhelming planning that just dwarfs

129
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,280
any human ingenuity.

130
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,600
And we see that same attention to detail

131
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,840
when we move beyond the sun to the moon

132
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,359
and stars. They have their own distinct

133
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,199
complimentary movements.

134
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,840
Yes. And the contrast between the sun

135
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,759
and the moon is well, it's pretty stark.

136
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,600
Functionally speaking, the moon is

137
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,320
mainly a calendar tool for measuring

138
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,560
months.

139
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,639
But its cycle is dynamic. It waxes and

140
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,639
waines. So lunar months don't line up

141
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,960
with the solar year and the seasons.

142
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,120
Exactly. Maharing can happen in summer

143
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,840
or winter or the rainy season. It

144
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,360
shifts.

145
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,520
So what's the wisdom there? I mean the

146
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,759
moon still gives us light at night.

147
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,080
The wisdom is multi-layered. Since we

148
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,280
need the coolness of darkness for rest,

149
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,080
moonlight is purposefully less luminous.

150
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,280
It provides a glimmer, just enough light

151
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,639
for necessary night work,

152
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,320
like farming or travel,

153
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,560
right? But it preserves the required

154
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,479
rest. It stops people from being tempted

155
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,440
to work themselves, as the text says,

156
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,880
even unto death. It offers utility but

157
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,880
without sacrificing comfort.

158
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,320
Now what about the stars? They present a

159
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,360
really compelling argument against

160
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,120
creation by chance.

161
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,440
They do because they have two distinct

162
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,199
kinds of motion. Some are stationary and

163
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,280
others move from zone to zone.

164
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,120
And the argument is if this were all

165
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,080
just chance, why wouldn't they all move

166
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,160
the same way?

167
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Precisely. The variety of movement

168
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,440
points to a definite intelligent

169
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,120
purpose. The source uses this uh this

170
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,840
brilliant analogy to explain the

171
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,320
complexity.

172
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,240
Oh, what's that? Think of an ant on the

173
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,000
upper moving piece of a grindstoneone.

174
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,639
An ant on a grindstoneone.

175
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,720
That ant has two velocities. Its own

176
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,400
intrinsic direction as it crawls and

177
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,080
then the unintended velocity it has

178
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,199
because the whole stone is moving. It's

179
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,280
a cosmic motion.

180
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,400
I see. So the stationary stars like the

181
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,479
bear constellation.

182
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,160
They serve as constant signposts

183
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,639
for navigation across oceans, across

184
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,880
planes.

185
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,639
While the moving stars, the planets

186
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,000
provide specific information for things

187
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,160
like crop seasons. Yes, that duality of

188
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
fixed points and moving instruments.

189
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,280
It's presented as proof against the idea

190
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,199
of mere chaos.

191
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,280
And the design isn't just about utility.

192
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,680
It's also about protection. The sun,

193
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,319
moon, stars, they move incredibly fast.

194
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,240
And they possess immense brilliance. But

195
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,479
they are placed at these vast distances

196
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,319
from us. Well, if they were any nearer

197
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,919
and we felt their true speed and

198
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,840
brilliance,

199
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,240
our eyesight would be immediately

200
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,319
dazzled and corrupted. The text compares

201
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,160
it to continuous lightning or

202
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
or a ceiling studded with rapidly

203
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,360
revolving live candles.

204
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,319
That sounds absolutely catastrophic. The

205
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,759
eyes would be ruined.

206
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,080
You'd be thrown prostrate on their

207
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,919
faces. So, their tremendous speed, which

208
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,160
is required for their cosmic functions,

209
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,639
is paired with this vast protective

210
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,960
distance. The function is maintained,

211
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,280
but our srail senses are shielded.

212
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,520
That level of detail is incredible. And

213
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,520
that same meticulous design applies to

214
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,520
the four fundamental elements here on

215
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,199
Earth. Starting with the Earth itself,

216
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,280
it has to be vast enough for

217
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,800
civilization and agriculture, but it

218
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,880
also has to be stable.

219
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,199
That stability is non-negotiable, isn't

220
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,120
it? If the Earth were constantly tilting

221
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,560
or quaking, all trade and industry would

222
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,160
just stop.

223
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,680
It would grind to a halt. And if someone

224
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,000
then asked, "Well, why do earthquakes

225
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,039
happen at all?" The source gives a

226
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,639
profound answer

227
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,800
that they aren't arbitrary. They're

228
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,759
admonition and warnings. warnings

229
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,000
against evildoing. Yes, the idea is that

230
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,400
the resulting improvement in faith

231
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,400
outweighs the material loss. It's a kind

232
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,400
of calculated spiritual procedure.

233
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,400
We also see that thoughtful design in

234
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,759
the earth's geography. It has this

235
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,160
gradual slope

236
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,120
north to south. It acts like a massive

237
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,960
sloping roof

238
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,400
which ensures that surplus water flows

239
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,840
naturally to the sea.

240
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,639
And without that, the earth would be

241
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,400
perpetually swamped with stagnant water.

242
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,800
It would cause disease. It would hinder

243
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,759
travel. It's a drainage system on a

244
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,240
planetary scale.

245
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,240
And water itself is so multifunctional

246
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
beyond just life and agriculture. The

247
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,879
source highlights its role in commerce

248
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,840
and a huge role. Water is described as

249
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,520
this vast means of transport. Boats

250
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,280
carrying mountains of merchandise,

251
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,039
which allows for global trade. It's also

252
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,120
a treasure house for things like pearls

253
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,280
and amber grease. And without that mass

254
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,720
transport, trade would be limited to

255
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,560
what you could carry on the back of an

256
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
animal, which would be prohibitively

257
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,639
expensive

258
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,919
and would limit prosperity and the

259
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,759
exchange of ideas.

260
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,759
Absolutely. Then you have air. It's

261
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,440
foundational to life, of course, but the

262
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,160
detail about sound transmission is just

263
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,919
remarkable.

264
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,800
It has to do with speech leaving an

265
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,880
impression right now.

266
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,959
Exactly. People are talking constantly.

267
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,760
If every word spoken left a prominent

268
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,279
impression in the air, as writing leaves

269
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,560
an impression on paper,

270
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,519
the whole atmosphere would be

271
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,880
perpetually full of noise, a giant

272
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,519
chaotic chalkboard.

273
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,240
It would cause immediate uneasiness,

274
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,720
perplexity. So, the creator designed air

275
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,000
as this mysterious medium that holds the

276
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,480
impression just long enough to

277
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,360
communicate

278
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,360
and then it's gone.

279
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,519
And then it instantly performs a clean

280
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,839
slate operation, wiping the atmosphere

281
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,839
clean to receive fresh impressions. its

282
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,760
clarity built right into the system.

283
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,519
That is one of the most brilliant small

284
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,880
details in the text. The atmosphere is

285
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,600
continually erased for the next

286
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,560
conversation.

287
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,160
It really is.

288
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,800
Finally, let's look at fire. It's

289
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,800
essential, but it's constrained. Why?

290
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,279
Because if it were as abundant and

291
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,120
accessible as water or air, it would

292
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,920
have consumed everything in the world.

293
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,440
It's dangerous.

294
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,760
So, it's enshrined in wood

295
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,760
purposefully, and it's accessible only

296
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,680
to humans who were uniquely given the

297
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,399
palms and fingers needed to light it and

298
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,000
use it. animals who have no use for it

299
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,640
weren't given those parts.

300
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,800
It's focused utility and constraint

301
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,800
based on ability and need.

302
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,720
And that meticulous planning continues

303
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,880
right down to the microscopic level of

304
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,800
vegetation. Think about agriculture.

305
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,000
A single seed doesn't just yield a

306
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,000
single grain.

307
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,160
Logically, it could have. But wisdom

308
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
dictates a principle of purposeful

309
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,920
abundance.

310
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,839
Multiplication.

311
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,839
You get a 100 or so grains from a single

312
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,240
seed. The abundance is there to ensure

313
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,560
sustainability. The grain has to be your

314
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,160
food until the next crop is ready and

315
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,399
provide the seed you need to plant for

316
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,959
the next season. It's planning against

317
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,440
famine.

318
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,519
And plants can't move to find food.

319
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,920
No. So, they're gifted with roots which

320
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,440
function as mouths to draw nutrient from

321
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
the earth which is described as their

322
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,760
mother.

323
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,440
And this root system is another example

324
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,079
of wisdom that came before human

325
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,160
industry.

326
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,040
Yes, the huge roots supporting giant

327
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,640
trees, anchoring them against storms.

328
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,480
That was the original design that

329
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,079
artisans later copied with pegs and

330
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,600
ropes to support their tents.

331
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,079
Even the leaves are astonishingly

332
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,880
detailed. Fine capillaries and thicker

333
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,040
veins.

334
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,440
The fine ones irrigate the leaf like in

335
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,480
our bodies and the thicker veins provide

336
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,000
strength so the leaf doesn't tear. A

337
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,959
design that's now replicated in

338
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
manufacturing.

339
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,120
And the pomegranate, it's described like

340
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,440
a perfectly designed storage system.

341
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,440
grains layered, separated by membranes

342
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,560
that are both nutritive and keep them

343
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,079
immovably fixed, all inside a tough

344
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,880
protective rind. That is microlevel

345
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,880
engineering.

346
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,600
The timing of plant growth is also

347
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,120
deliberate. The text mentions creepers

348
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,880
like gourds and melons.

349
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,399
They sprawl on the earth because their

350
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,120
yield is too heavy to be supported

351
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,440
upright. And crucially, they're ordained

352
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,959
to flourish in the fiery heat of summer.

353
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,800
Precisely when people want their

354
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,000
coolness and moisture. If they grew in

355
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,200
winter, people couldn't bear the

356
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,040
coldness. It would probably cause

357
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
ailments. It's the right food at the

358
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,079
right time.

359
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,120
And this lesson extends even to things

360
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,200
we'd consider mundane or even worthless.

361
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,880
Yes. Like the karaabarati plant,

362
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,040
considered lowly, but it's used for

363
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,320
paper and mats. Or even worthless

364
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
pollution like cow dung,

365
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,040
which has unparalleled benefits as

366
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,959
manure.

367
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,640
Exactly. It shows that value is often

368
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,560
hidden. It's not just about what

369
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,800
something is worth in a market. So

370
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,160
finally, let's revisit that idea of

371
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,920
alternation, rain and clear skies. We

372
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,720
know that too much of either is a

373
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,760
disaster.

374
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,640
Constant rain causes rot. Constant sun

375
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,360
causes wittering. So you need regular

376
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,079
thoughtful alternation for an equitable

377
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,079
climate.

378
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,480
And the method of delivery is planned.

379
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,600
Rain falls from high up to irrigate the

380
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,279
highest lands first.

381
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
And it comes as mild showers, not

382
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,200
floods. that allows the ground time to

383
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,839
soak and it prevents crops from being

384
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,279
uprooted.

385
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,120
But that brings us back to that really

386
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,680
critical question. If the world is

387
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,040
designed for welfare, why are there

388
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
damaging rains? Why are there

389
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,079
catastrophic earthquakes?

390
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,160
It's very challenging point, but the

391
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,399
text argues the design's focus isn't

392
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,079
solely on worldly comfort, but on the

393
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,160
ultimate condition of humanity.

394
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,279
So these calamities are the admonition

395
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,519
and warnings again

396
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,360
to keep us from evildoing. It forces

397
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,200
humanity to seek beneficence and

398
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,760
improvement. the resulting spiritual

399
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,519
uplift, the refinement of faith that's

400
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,839
deemed more valuable in the grand scheme

401
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,560
than the temporary material damage.

402
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,600
So if we bring all this together, the

403
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,440
macro and the micro, what have we seen?

404
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,519
We have this regulated plan in

405
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,200
everything from the sun's motion to the

406
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,680
engineering of a pomegranate.

407
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,079
And the central synthesis is just it's

408
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,079
incredibly clear. These stupendous

409
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,720
systems working automatically without

410
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,240
negligence. They cannot possibly be the

411
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,320
result of mere chance.

412
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,519
The text offers that powerful analogy,

413
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,000
the Persian wheel.

414
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,160
Yes. No reasonable person would look at

415
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
an irrigation tool manufactured with a

416
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,160
definite plan and say it came about by

417
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,440
chance that the wood and iron just

418
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,120
happened to assemble themselves.

419
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,360
Of course not. So if you can't attribute

420
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,760
a simple machine to chance, how can you

421
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,160
attribute this entire complex universe

422
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,399
full of projects beyond our imagination

423
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,519
to mere chance without any skill or

424
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,800
design or measure?

425
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,519
And that brings us to our final

426
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,040
provocative thought for you to ponder.

427
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,240
It relates to the principle of

428
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,720
constrained knowledge.

429
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,320
Okay.

430
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,480
The source notes that men were given the

431
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,480
ability to change copper into brass,

432
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,160
which doesn't do much harm, but the

433
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,000
complete knowledge to convert base

434
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,160
materials into gold and silver was

435
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,680
purposefully withheld. And why was that?

436
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,240
Because if that knowledge became

437
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,399
general, if everyone could make endless

438
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,399
amounts of gold, the abundance would

439
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,639
make it worthless. It would collapse the

440
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,440
entire economic system of trade and

441
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,040
value.

442
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,040
So the stability of the world is

443
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,320
maintained by purposefully limiting the

444
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,519
abundance of gold.

445
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Which leaves you with an important

446
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,720
question. If that's true for economics,

447
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,240
what other areas of knowledge might be

448
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,639
purposefully constrained?

449
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,120
What other abundances might be limited?

450
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,639
maybe in energy or communication or even

451
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,959
life sciences

452
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,959
all to maintain a necessary order and a

453
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,079
value and a stability that we don't

454
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,760
fully understand.

455
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,360
That is certainly worth pondering as you

456
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,800
move forward. We have covered a lot of

457
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,959
ground today. Thank you for joining us
